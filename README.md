# WBC GATEWAY API

The purpose of this application is to facilitate and abstract communication with the WBC and its different forms of communication.
In certain scenarios, WBC utilizes either SOAP or REST protocols for their API. If an API is not available, RPA is used to communicate asynchronously with the [wbc-gateway-worker](https://github.com/Matrix-Energia/matrix.wbc.gateway.worker) application for automation purposes.
